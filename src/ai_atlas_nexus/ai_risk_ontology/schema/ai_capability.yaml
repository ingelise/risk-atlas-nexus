    description: >-
      A specific AI capability or ability, such as reading comprehension, logical reasoning, or code generation.
      Aligned with the W3C DPV AI extension dpv-ai:Capability, representing what an AI technology is capable of achieving or providing.
      Capabilities are distinct from:
      (1) the intended purpose for which the technology is designed,
      (2) the actual tasks performed in a specific deployment context, and
      (3) the technical implementation mechanisms (intrinsics, adapters) that enable the capability.
