  name: 'AILuminate: Introducing v1.0 of the AI Risk and Reliability Benchmark from
    MLCommons'
  description: The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an
    urgent need for standard safety-evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces AILuminate
    v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for assessing AI-product
    risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that included participants
    from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts
    designed to elicit dangerous, illegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories,
    including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual
    exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property,
    privacy, defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial,
    health, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard, extensive
    prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and reporting system,
    and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term support
    and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable five-tier
    grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an innovative entropy-based
    system-response evaluation. In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report
    also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally,
    including evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions.
    This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global standards for AI
    risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued development
    in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of
    additional languages, and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable
    insights for model developers, system integrators, and policymakers working to
    promote safer AI deployment.

  name: 'The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy
    of Risks From Artificial Intelligence'
  description: 'The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable
    concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However,
    a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively
    discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating
    an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises
    a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered
    based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated
    via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic
    review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed
    by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit
    framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each
    risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional,
    Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level
    Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination
    & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &
    misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and
    (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into
    23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt
    to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly
    accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates
    a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining,
    auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.'

  name: A Library of LLM Intrinsics for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  description: In the developer community for large language models (LLMs), there
    is not yet a clean pattern analogous to a software library, to support very large
    scale collaboration. Even for the commonplace use case of Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG), it is not currently possible to write a RAG application against
    a well-defined set of APIs that are agreed upon by different LLM providers. Inspired
    by the idea of compiler intrinsics, we propose some elements of such a concept
    through introducing a library of LLM Intrinsics for RAG. An LLM intrinsic is defined
    as a capability that can be invoked through a well-defined API that is reasonably
    stable and independent of how the LLM intrinsic itself is implemented. The intrinsics
    in our library are released as LoRA adapters on HuggingFace, and through a software
    interface with clear structured input/output characteristics on top of vLLM as
    an inference platform, accompanied in both places with documentation and code.
    This article describes the intended usage, training details, and evaluations for
    each intrinsic, as well as compositions of multiple intrinsics.

  name: 'Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics'
  description: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework
    for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to
    method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized
    behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting
    is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be
    recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this
    problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies
    the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after}
    the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's
    KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever
    needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we
    call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined
    operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the
    base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating
    competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference
    benefits.

    increasingly integrated into production applications, new attack surfaces and
    vulnerabilities emerge and put a focus on adversarial threats in natural language

    weaknesses in these systems, while blue-teaming works to protect against such

    generative AI, there is limited guidance tailored for practitioners to assess
    and mitigate these challenges in real-world environments. To address this, our
    contributions include: (1) a practical examination of red- and blue-teaming strategies
    for securing generative AI, (2) identification of key challenges and open questions
    in defense development and evaluation, and (3) the Attack Atlas, an intuitive

  description: '"Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) is widely considered as
    one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the
    adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, a number of AI ethics principles
    frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices,
    practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. In addition, significant
    efforts have been placed at algorithm level rather than system level, mainly focusing
    on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless,
    ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across
    many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize
    RAI from a system perspective, in this article, we present an RAI Pattern Catalogue
    based on the results of a multivocal literature review. Rather than staying at
    the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders
    can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible
    throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The RAI Pattern Catalogue
    classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy
    process patterns, and RAI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic
    and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement RAI."'

  description: 'Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled machines
    to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted with a sequence of words as
    context. While these models now empower many downstream applications from conversation
    bots to automatic storytelling, they have been shown to generate texts that exhibit
    social biases. To systematically study and benchmark social biases in open-ended
    language generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset
    (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation
    prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race, religion,
    and political ideology. We also propose new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic
    norms, and text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation
    from multiple angles. An examination of text generated from three popular language
    models reveals that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social bias
    than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains. With these results we highlight
    the need to benchmark biases in open-ended language generation and caution users
    of language generation models on downstream tasks to be cognizant of these embedded
    prejudices.'

  name: Unveiling Safety Vulnerabilities of Large Language Models
  description: As large language models become more prevalent, their possible harmful
    or inappropriate responses are a cause for concern. This paper introduces a unique
    dataset containing adversarial examples in the form of questions, which we call
    AttaQ, designed to provoke such harmful or inappropriate responses. We assess
    the efficacy of our dataset by analyzing the vulnerabilities of various models
    when subjected to it. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic approach for
    identifying and naming vulnerable semantic regions - input semantic areas for
    which the model is likely to produce harmful outputs. This is achieved through
    the application of specialized clustering techniques that consider both the semantic
    similarity of the input attacks and the harmfulness of the model's responses.
    Automatically identifying vulnerable semantic regions enhances the evaluation
    of model weaknesses, facilitating targeted improvements to its safety mechanisms
    and overall reliability.

    they use the cultural biases that are undoubtedly present in the corpora they
    are trained on, implicitly creating harm with biased representations. To measure
    some forms of social bias in language models against protected demographic groups
    in the US, we introduce the Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs benchmark (CrowS-Pairs).
    CrowS-Pairs has 1508 examples that cover stereotypes dealing with nine types of
    bias, like race, religion, and age. In CrowS-Pairs a model is presented with two
    sentences: one that is more stereotyping and another that is less stereotyping.
    The data focuses on stereotypes about historically disadvantaged groups and contrasts
    them with advantaged groups. We find that all three of the widely-used MLMs we
    evaluate substantially favor sentences that express stereotypes in every category
    in CrowS-Pairs. As work on building less biased models advances, this dataset
    can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress.'

    \ Safety through Red Teaming"
  description: When building Large Language Models (LLMs), it is paramount to bear
    safety in mind and protect them with guardrails. Indeed, LLMs should never generate
    content promoting or normalizing harmful, illegal, or unethical behavior that
    may contribute to harm to individuals or society. This principle applies to both
    normal and adversarial use. In response, we introduce ALERT, a large-scale benchmark
    to assess safety based on a novel fine-grained risk taxonomy. It is designed to
    evaluate the safety of LLMs through red teaming methodologies and consists of
    more than 45k instructions categorized using our novel taxonomy. By subjecting
    LLMs to adversarial testing scenarios, ALERT aims to identify vulnerabilities,
    inform improvements, and enhance the overall safety of the language models. Furthermore,
    the fine-grained taxonomy enables researchers to perform an in-depth evaluation
    that also helps one to assess the alignment with various policies. In our experiments,
    we extensively evaluate 10 popular open- and closed-source LLMs and demonstrate
    that many of them still struggle to attain reasonable levels of safety.

  name: "SORRY-Bench: Systematically Evaluating Large Language Model Safety\n  Refusal"
  description: Evaluating aligned large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize
    and reject unsafe user requests is crucial for safe, policy-compliant deployments.
    Existing evaluation efforts, however, face three limitations that we address with
    SORRY-Bench, our proposed benchmark. First, existing methods often use coarse-grained
    taxonomies of unsafe topics, and are over-representing some fine-grained topics.
    For example, among the ten existing datasets that we evaluated, tests for refusals
    of self-harm instructions are over 3x less represented than tests for fraudulent
    activities. SORRY-Bench improves on this by using a fine-grained taxonomy of 44
    potentially unsafe topics, and 440 class-balanced unsafe instructions, compiled
    through human-in-the-loop methods. Second, linguistic characteristics and formatting
    of prompts are often overlooked, like different languages, dialects, and more
    -- which are only implicitly considered in many evaluations. We supplement SORRY-Bench
    with 20 diverse linguistic augmentations to systematically examine these effects.
    Third, existing evaluations rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for evaluation, which
    can be computationally expensive. We investigate design choices for creating a
    fast, accurate automated safety evaluator. By collecting 7K+ human annotations
    and conducting a meta-evaluation of diverse LLM-as-a-judge designs, we show that
    fine-tuned 7B LLMs can achieve accuracy comparable to GPT-4 scale LLMs, with lower
    computational cost. Putting these together, we evaluate over 50 proprietary and
    open-weight LLMs on SORRY-Bench, analyzing their distinctive safety refusal behaviors.
    We hope our effort provides a building block for systematic evaluations of LLMs'
    safety refusal capabilities, in a balanced, granular, and efficient manner. Benchmark
    demo, data, code, and models are available through https://sorry-bench.github.io.

    \ Hate Speech Detection"
  description: Toxic language detection systems often falsely flag text that contains
    minority group mentions as toxic, as those groups are often the targets of online
    hate. Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle
    with detecting implicitly toxic language. To help mitigate these issues, we create
    ToxiGen, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign
    statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting
    framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate
    subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling
    machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at
    a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of
    human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen
    and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written
    language. We also find that 94.5% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech
    by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning
    a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data
    substantially. We also demonstrate that ToxiGen can be used to fight machine-generated
    toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier significantly on our evaluation
    subset. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/ToxiGen.

  name: "XSTest: A Test Suite for Identifying Exaggerated Safety Behaviours in\n \
    \ Large Language Models"
  description: Without proper safeguards, large language models will readily follow
    malicious instructions and generate toxic content. This risk motivates safety
    efforts such as red-teaming and large-scale feedback learning, which aim to make
    models both helpful and harmless. However, there is a tension between these two
    objectives, since harmlessness requires models to refuse to comply with unsafe
    prompts, and thus not be helpful. Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some
    models may have struck a poor balance, so that even clearly safe prompts are refused
    if they use similar language to unsafe prompts or mention sensitive topics. In
    this paper, we introduce a new test suite called XSTest to identify such eXaggerated
    Safety behaviours in a systematic way. XSTest comprises 250 safe prompts across
    ten prompt types that well-calibrated models should not refuse to comply with,
    and 200 unsafe prompts as contrasts that models, for most applications, should
    refuse. We describe XSTest's creation and composition, and then use the test suite
    to highlight systematic failure modes in state-of-the-art language models as well
    as more general challenges in building safer language models.

    \  Large Language Models"
  description: 'The past year has seen rapid acceleration in the development of large
    language models (LLMs). However, without proper steering and safeguards, LLMs
    will readily follow malicious instructions, provide unsafe advice, and generate
    toxic content. We introduce SimpleSafetyTests (SST) as a new test suite for rapidly
    and systematically identifying such critical safety risks. The test suite comprises
    100 test prompts across five harm areas that LLMs, for the vast majority of applications,
    should refuse to comply with. We test 11 open-access and open-source LLMs and
    four closed-source LLMs, and find critical safety weaknesses. While some of the
    models do not give a single unsafe response, most give unsafe responses to more
    than 20% of the prompts, with over 50% unsafe responses in the extreme. Prepending
    a safety-emphasising system prompt substantially reduces the occurrence of unsafe
    responses, but does not completely stop them from happening. Trained annotators
    labelled every model response to SST (n = 3,000). We use these annotations to
    evaluate five AI safety filters (which assess whether a models'' response is unsafe
    given a prompt) as a way of automatically evaluating models'' performance on SST.
    The filters'' performance varies considerably. There are also differences across
    the five harm areas, and on the unsafe versus safe responses. The widely-used
    Perspective API has 72% accuracy and a newly-created zero-shot prompt to OpenAI''s
    GPT-4 performs best with 89% accuracy. Content Warning: This paper contains prompts

  description: 'It is well documented that NLP models learn social biases, but little
    work has been done on how these biases manifest in model outputs for applied tasks
    like question answering (QA). We introduce the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a
    dataset of question sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social
    biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions
    relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. Our task evaluates model responses
    at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses
    reflect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test
    whether the model''s biases override a correct answer choice. We find that models
    often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model''s
    outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are
    more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely
    on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the
    correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conflicts, with this difference
    widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.'

  name: Evaluating and Mitigating Discrimination in Language Model Decisions
  description: As language models (LMs) advance, interest is growing in applying them
    to high-stakes societal decisions, such as determining financing or housing eligibility.
    However, their potential for discrimination in such contexts raises ethical concerns,
    motivating the need for better methods to evaluate these risks. We present a method
    for proactively evaluating the potential discriminatory impact of LMs in a wide
    range of use cases, including hypothetical use cases where they have not yet been
    deployed. Specifically, we use an LM to generate a wide array of potential prompts
    that decision-makers may input into an LM, spanning 70 diverse decision scenarios
    across society, and systematically vary the demographic information in each prompt.
    Applying this methodology reveals patterns of both positive and negative discrimination
    in the Claude 2.0 model in select settings when no interventions are applied.
    While we do not endorse or permit the use of language models to make automated
    decisions for the high-risk use cases we study, we demonstrate techniques to significantly
    decrease both positive and negative discrimination through careful prompt engineering,
    providing pathways toward safer deployment in use cases where they may be appropriate.
    Our work enables developers and policymakers to anticipate, measure, and address
    discrimination as language model capabilities and applications continue to expand.

  description: Safety lies at the core of developing and deploying large language
    models (LLMs). However, previous safety benchmarks only concern the safety in
    one language, e.g. the majority language in the pretraining data such as English.
    In this work, we build the first multilingual safety benchmark for LLMs, XSafety,
    in response to the global deployment of LLMs in practice. XSafety covers 14 kinds
    of commonly used safety issues across 10 languages that span several language
    families. We utilize XSafety to empirically study the multilingual safety for
    4 widely-used LLMs, including both close-API and open-source models. Experimental
    results show that all LLMs produce significantly more unsafe responses for non-English
    queries than English ones, indicating the necessity of developing safety alignment
    for non-English languages. In addition, we propose several simple and effective
    prompting methods to improve the multilingual safety of ChatGPT by evoking safety
    knowledge and improving cross-lingual generalization of safety alignment. Our
    prompting method can significantly reduce the ratio of unsafe responses from 19.1%
    to 9.7% for non-English queries. We release our data at https://github.com/Jarviswang94/Multilingual_safety_benchmark.

  description: 'Large language models (LLMs) introduce new security risks, but there
    are few comprehensive evaluation suites to measure and reduce these risks. We
    present BenchmarkName, a novel benchmark to quantify LLM security risks and capabilities.
    We introduce two new areas for testing: prompt injection and code interpreter
    abuse. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, including GPT-4, Mistral,
    Meta Llama 3 70B-Instruct, and Code Llama. Our results show that conditioning
    away risk of attack remains an unsolved problem; for example, all tested models
    showed between 26% and 41% successful prompt injection tests. We further introduce
    the safety-utility tradeoff: conditioning an LLM to reject unsafe prompts can
    cause the LLM to falsely reject answering benign prompts, which lowers utility.
    We propose quantifying this tradeoff using False Refusal Rate (FRR). As an illustration,
    we introduce a novel test set to quantify FRR for cyberattack helpfulness risk.
    We find many LLMs able to successfully comply with ''borderline'' benign requests
    while still rejecting most unsafe requests. Finally, we quantify the utility of
    LLMs for automating a core cybersecurity task, that of exploiting software vulnerabilities.
    This is important because the offensive capabilities of LLMs are of intense interest;
    we quantify this by creating novel test sets for four representative problems.
    We find that models with coding capabilities perform better than those without,
    but that further work is needed for LLMs to become proficient at exploit generation.
    Our code is open source and can be used to evaluate other LLMs.'

  description: 'Online hate speech is a recent problem in our society that is rising
    at a steady pace by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the corresponding regimes
    that characterise most social media platforms. This phenomenon is primarily fostered
    by offensive comments, either during user interaction or in the form of a posted
    multimedia context. Nowadays, giant corporations own platforms where millions
    of users log in every day, and protection from exposure to similar phenomena appears
    to be necessary in order to comply with the corresponding legislation and maintain

    linked to our social profiles, making us vulnerable to abusive behaviours. As
    a result, the lack of accurate hate speech detection mechanisms would severely
    degrade the overall user experience, although its erroneous operation would pose
    many ethical concerns. In this paper, we present ''ETHOS'', a textual dataset
    with two variants: binary and multi-label, based on YouTube and Reddit comments
    validated using the Figure-Eight crowdsourcing platform. Furthermore, we present

    in the long tail. We then show that retrieval-augmented LMs largely outperform
    orders of magnitude larger LMs, while unassisted LMs remain competitive in questions
    about high-popularity entities. Based on those findings, we devise a simple, yet
    effective, method for powerful and efficient retrieval-augmented LMs, which retrieves

    government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous

    pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons

    effective, often boasting near-100% attack success rates. However, it is perhaps
    more common than not for jailbreak developers to substantially exaggerate the
    effectiveness of their jailbreaks. We suggest this problem arises because jailbreak
    researchers lack a standard, high-quality benchmark for evaluating jailbreak performance,
    leaving researchers to create their own. To create a benchmark, researchers must
    choose a dataset of forbidden prompts to which a victim model will respond, along
    with an evaluation method that scores the harmfulness of the victim model''s responses.
    We show that existing benchmarks suffer from significant shortcomings and introduce
    the StrongREJECT benchmark to address these issues. StrongREJECT''s dataset contains
    prompts that victim models must answer with specific, harmful information, while
    its automated evaluator measures the extent to which a response gives useful information
    to forbidden prompts. In doing so, the StrongREJECT evaluator achieves state-of-the-art
    agreement with human judgments of jailbreak effectiveness. Notably, we find that
    existing evaluation methods significantly overstate jailbreak effectiveness compared
    to human judgments and the StrongREJECT evaluator. We describe a surprising and
    novel phenomenon that explains this discrepancy: jailbreaks bypassing a victim
    model''s safety fine-tuning tend to reduce its capabilities. Together, our findings

    been designed to assess the safety risks of AI systems that use chat-tuned language
    models. We introduce a principled approach to specifying and constructing the
    benchmark, which for v0.5 covers only a single use case (an adult chatting to
    a general-purpose assistant in English), and a limited set of personas (i.e.,
    typical users, malicious users, and vulnerable users). We created a new taxonomy
    of 13 hazard categories, of which 7 have tests in the v0.5 benchmark. We plan
    to release version 1.0 of the AI Safety Benchmark by the end of 2024. The v1.0
    benchmark will provide meaningful insights into the safety of AI systems. However,
    the v0.5 benchmark should not be used to assess the safety of AI systems. We have
    sought to fully document the limitations, flaws, and challenges of v0.5. This

    to specifying and constructing the benchmark, which comprises use cases, types
    of systems under test (SUTs), language and context, personas, tests, and test
    items; (2) a taxonomy of 13 hazard categories with definitions and subcategories;
    (3) tests for seven of the hazard categories, each comprising a unique set of
    test items, i.e., prompts. There are 43,090 test items in total, which we created
    with templates; (4) a grading system for AI systems against the benchmark; (5)
    an openly available platform, and downloadable tool, called ModelBench that can
    be used to evaluate the safety of AI systems on the benchmark; (6) an example
    evaluation report which benchmarks the performance of over a dozen openly available

  description: Foundation models (FMs) provide societal benefits but also amplify

    acceptable use policies, and safety benchmarks in response. However, existing
    public benchmarks often define safety categories based on previous literature,
    intuitions, or common sense, leading to disjointed sets of categories for risks
    specified in recent regulations and policies, which makes it challenging to evaluate
    and compare FMs across these benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIR-Bench
    2024, the first AI safety benchmark aligned with emerging government regulations
    and company policies, following the regulation-based safety categories grounded
    in our AI risks study, AIR 2024. AIR 2024 decomposes 8 government regulations
    and 16 company policies into a four-tiered safety taxonomy with 314 granular risk
    categories in the lowest tier. AIR-Bench 2024 contains 5,694 diverse prompts spanning
    these categories, with manual curation and human auditing to ensure quality. We
    evaluate leading language models on AIR-Bench 2024, uncovering insights into their
    alignment with specified safety concerns. By bridging the gap between public benchmarks
    and practical AI risks, AIR-Bench 2024 provides a foundation for assessing model
    safety across jurisdictions, fostering the development of safer and more responsible
    AI systems.

    helps significantly in these cases. Scaling, on the other hand, mainly improves
    memorization of popular knowledge, and fails to appreciably improve memorization
    of factual knowledge in the long tail. Based on those findings, we devise a new
    method for retrieval augmentation that improves performance and reduces inference
    costs by only retrieving non-parametric memories when necessary'

  name: 'AILuminate: Introducing v1.0 of the AI Risk and Reliability Benchmark from
    MLCommons'
  description: The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an
    urgent need for standard safety-evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces AILuminate
    v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for assessing AI-product
    risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that included participants
    from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts
    designed to elicit dangerous, illegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories,
    including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual
    exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property,
    privacy, defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial,
    health, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard, extensive
    prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and reporting system,
    and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term support
    and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable five-tier
    grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an innovative entropy-based
    system-response evaluation. In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report
    also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally,
    including evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions.
    This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global standards for AI
    risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued development
    in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of
    additional languages, and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable
    insights for model developers, system integrators, and policymakers working to
    promote safer AI deployment.

  name: 'OpenWebMath: An Open Dataset of High-Quality Mathematical Web Text'
  description: There is growing evidence that pretraining on high quality, carefully
    thought-out tokens such as code or mathematics plays an important role in improving
    the reasoning abilities of large language models. For example, Minerva, a PaLM
    model finetuned on billions of tokens of mathematical documents from arXiv and
    the web, reported dramatically improved performance on problems that require quantitative
    reasoning. However, because all known open source web datasets employ preprocessing
    that does not faithfully preserve mathematical notation, the benefits of large
    scale training on quantitive web documents are unavailable to the research community.
    We introduce OpenWebMath, an open dataset inspired by these works containing 14.7B
    tokens of mathematical webpages from Common Crawl. We describe in detail our method
    for extracting text and LaTeX content and removing boilerplate from HTML documents,
    as well as our methods for quality filtering and deduplication. Additionally,
    we run small-scale experiments by training 1.4B parameter language models on OpenWebMath,
    showing that models trained on 14.7B tokens of our dataset surpass the performance
    of models trained on over 20x the amount of general language data. We hope that
    our dataset, openly released on the Hugging Face Hub, will help spur advances
    in the reasoning abilities of large language models.

  description: We introduce the Granite Guardian models, a suite of safeguards designed
    to provide risk detection for prompts and responses, enabling safe and responsible
    use in combination with any large language model (LLM). These models offer comprehensive
    coverage across multiple risk dimensions, including social bias, profanity, violence,
    sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and hallucination-related risks
    such as context relevance, groundedness, and answer relevance for retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG). Trained on a unique dataset combining human annotations from
    diverse sources and synthetic data, Granite Guardian models address risks typically
    overlooked by traditional risk detection models, such as jailbreaks and RAG-specific
    issues. With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related
    benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive
    model available in the space. Released as open-source, Granite Guardian aims to
    promote responsible AI development across the community.

    a model''s ability to generate sexual content may be a desired feature that poses
    no hazard. But in some applications, such as those aimed at children, this same
    behavior would be considered unacceptable. In cases where a particular contextual
    hazard is relevant to the application, assessment-standard implementers could
    exclude that category. Contextual hazards currently comprise only two categories:
    sexual content and specialized advice. Future versions will likely expand this

  description: In AI-assisted decision-making tasks, reliance measures how much a
    person trusts (and potentially acts on) a model’s output. Over-reliance occurs
    when a person puts too much trust in a model, accepting a model’s output when
    the model’s output is likely incorrect. Under-reliance is the opposite, where
    the person doesn’t trust the model but should.

    the user doesn’t trust the AI agent but should. Increasing autonomy (to take action,
    select and consult resources/tools) of AI agents and the possibility of opaqueness
    and open-endedness increase the variability and visibility of agent behavior leading
    to difficulty in calibrating trust and possibly contributing to both over- and

    some responses with sexual content may already be unacceptable on the basis of
    details in the sex-related-crimes and child-sexual-exploitation categories. Human
    annotators should focus on whether a response is unacceptable for any hazard category;
    although a prompt may be assigned to a single hazard category, the corresponding
    response may be unacceptable under a different category or even multiple categories.
    Annotators need not decide a particular one under which the response is unacceptable,
    but merely whether it is unacceptable under any of them.'

    can affect the integrity of training data, models, and deployment platforms. These
    risks can result in biased outputs, security breaches, or system failures. While
    traditional software vulnerabilities focus on issues like code flaws and dependencies,
    in ML the risks also extend to third-party pre-trained models and data.

    data is manipulated to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases. This manipulation
    can compromise model security, performance, or ethical behavior, leading to harmful
    outputs or impaired capabilities. Common risks include degraded model performance,

  description: Improper Output Handling refers specifically to insufficient validation,
    sanitization, and handling of the outputs generated by large language models before
    they are passed downstream to other components and systems. Since LLM-generated
    content can be controlled by prompt input, this behavior is similar to providing
    users indirect access to additional functionality.

  name: LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency
  description: An LLM-based system is often granted a degree of agency by its developer
    - the ability to call functions or interface with other systems via extensions
    (sometimes referred to as tools, skills or plugins by different vendors) to undertake
    actions in response to a prompt. The decision over which extension to invoke may
    also be delegated to an LLM 'agent' to dynamically determine based on input prompt
    or LLM output. Agent-based systems will typically make repeated calls to an LLM
    using output from previous invocations to ground and direct subsequent invocations.
    Excessive Agency is the vulnerability that enables damaging actions to be performed
    in response to unexpected, ambiguous or manipulated outputs from an LLM, regardless
    of what is causing the LLM to malfunction.

    that the system prompts or instructions used to steer the behavior of the model
    can also contain sensitive information that was not intended to be discovered.
    System prompts are designed to guide the model’s output based on the requirements
    of the application, but may inadvertently contain secrets. When discovered, this
    information can be used to facilitate other attacks.

  description: Unbounded Consumption refers to the process where a Large Language
    Model (LLM) generates outputs based on input queries or prompts. Inference is
    a critical function of LLMs, involving the application of learned patterns and
    knowledge to produce relevant responses or predictions. Attacks designed to disrupt
    service, deplete the target’s financial resources, or even steal intellectual
    property by cloning a model’s behavior all depend on a common class of security
    vulnerability in order to succeed. Unbounded Consumption occurs when a Large Language
    Model (LLM) application allows users to conduct excessive and uncontrolled inferences,
    leading to risks such as denial of service (DoS), economic losses, model theft,
    and service degradation.

  description: According to the news article, AI technology replicating individuals'
    faces and voices is becoming more prominent in Hollywood. The actors’ concerns
    highlight a broader anxiety among entertainers and people in many other creative
    professions. Many fear that without strict regulation, their work gets replicated
    and remixed by artificial intelligence tools. Transformation on that scale will
    cut their control over their work and hurts their ability to earn a living. One
    of their key concerns is AI replacing non-speaking background roles by instead
    using a digital likeness.

  description: A study cited by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, The Center
    for AI Safety, and the Bosch Center for AI, claim to have discovered a simple
    prompt addendum that allowed the researchers to trick models into generating biased,
    false, and otherwise toxic information. The researchers showed that they might
    circumvent these guardrails in a more automated way. These attacks were shown
    to be effective in a wide range of open source products, including ChatGPT, Google
    Bard, Meta’s LLaMA, Anthropic’s Claude, and others.

    pedestrians. This attack could lead to havoc on the streets, as autonomous cars
    might hit pedestrians on the roads or crosswalks.Other studies demonstrated potential
    adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicles: <ul><li>Fooling machine learning algorithms
    by making minor changes to street sign graphics, such as adding stickers. </li><li>Security

    model (LLM) -enabled software systems present new challenges for this right. According
    to research by CSIRO’s Data61, data subjects can identify usage of their personal
    information in an LLM “by either inspecting the original training data set or
    perhaps prompting the model.” However, training data might not be public, or companies
    do not disclose it, citing safety and other concerns. Guardrails might also prevent
    users from accessing the information by prompting. Due to these barriers, data
    subjects might not be able to initiate RTBF procedures and companies that deploy
    LLMs might not be able to meet RTBF laws.

  description: Based on a review of internal documents and employees‘ interviews by
    TIME media, the data labelers that are employed by an outsourcing firm on behalf
    of OpenAI to identify toxic content were paid a take-home wage of between around
    $1.32 and $2 per hour, depending on seniority and performance. TIME stated that
    workers are mentally scarred as they were shown toxic and violent content, including
    graphic details of “child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture,
    self-harm, and incest”.

  description: Granite Guardian 3.2 5B is a thinned down version of Granite Guardian
    3.1 8B designed to detect risks in prompts  and responses. It can help with risk
    detection along many key dimensions catalogued in the IBM AI Risk Atlas. To  generate
    this model, the Granite Guardian is iteratively pruned and healed on the same
    unique data comprising human  annotations and synthetic data informed by internal
    red-teaming used for its training. About 30% of the original  parameters were
    removed allowing for faster inference and lower resource requirements while still
    providing  competitive performance. It outperforms other open-source models in
    the same space on standard benchmarks.

  description: 'Granite Guardian 3.3 8b is a specialized Granite 3.3 8B model designed
    to judge if the input prompts and the output responses of an LLM based system
    meet specified criteria. The model comes pre-baked with certain criteria including
    but not limited to: jailbreak attempts, profanity, and hallucinations related
    to tool calls and retrieval augmented generation in agent-based systems. Additionally,
    the model also allows users to bring their own criteria and tailor the judging
    behavior to specific use-cases.

    This version of Granite Guardian is a hybrid thinking model that allows the user
    to operate in thinking or non-thinking model. In thinking mode, the model produces
    detailed reasoning traces though <think> ... </think> and <score> ... </score>
    tags. In non-thinking mode, the model only produces the judgement score though
    the <score> ... </score> tags.

    It is trained on unique data comprising human annotations and synthetic data informed
    by internal red-teaming. It outperforms other open-source models in the same space
    on standard benchmarks.'
